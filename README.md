# Batch Processing Scheduler
A batch processing scheduler is a system that automates the execution of batch files. These batch files can be scheduled to run at a specific time.

## Usage Overview
### Uploading Batch Files:
1. To upload batch files to the Node-RED Dashboard, either:
    - Drag and drop your batch files into the drop zone.
    - Click on the "Choose File" button and select your batch files for scheduling.
2. Your uploaded batch files will be automatically saved to your file directory.

### Batch Selection Tab:
1. After uploading batch files, navigate to the second tab.
2. In this tab, you'll find two tables:
    - The first table displays all uploaded batch files.
    - The second table shows batch files selected for scheduling.

### Selecting Batch Files for Scheduling:
1. To select batch files for scheduling, simply click on them in the first table.
2. Selected batch files will be displayed in the second table.
3. Once you've chosen the batch files for scheduling, you can start scheduling.
